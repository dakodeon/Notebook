Kodak Acedemy 200 is a film marketed in Europe and Asai only, and it's different from the pld Kodak movie film. It features high latitude, exceptional pushing performance, and very clear base. I don't have times for Rodinal or Microphen, but here are some times for other developes, 20 Celsius, manual tanks, aggitation at 1 min. I used to push this film to 800 with great results.
