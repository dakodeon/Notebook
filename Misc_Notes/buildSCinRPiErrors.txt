How to build supercollider 3.7 alpha on raspberry pi with emacs
support

I followed the instructions from:
http://supercollider.github.io/development/building-raspberrypi.html

but I had some issues:

a - I couldn't start jackd after following step 4 (install jack2 from
github). This was solved "magically" when I installed qjackctl (the
gui for jack), which automatically reinstalled jack2. Maybe I messed
up with the initial installation...

b - In step 5 (install sc3.7 alpha0 from github) in the cmake command,
there are some options like '-DSC_...=OFF'. You should replace
'DSC_EL=OFF' with 'DSC_EL=ON' for emacs support.

After that you can run supercollider following the instructions.

Unsolved issues:
There is always a "GUI scheme not installed" or something similar. It
doesn't affect performance, but is annoying.

For some reason, while working in terminal, I cannot boot the server
from within emacs. I have to open a shell in emacs, after running
'emacs -sclang' and follow the instructions in step 6 (start jack &
sclang & test sound) until I boot the server. After that, sc is
working in emacs.

I suspect this has to do with the way that sclang is started within emacs: When I start supercollider from the terminal, I start jack first, then scsynth and finally sclang. In emacs, first I start sclang and then jack and then scsynth.
Also, when starting sc in terminal, if I start sclang first, I get the same error, unless I open another terminal and start jack and scsynth there.
