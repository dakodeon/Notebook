1. Enable SPI from raspi-config
2. Follow the tutorials step about modprobe (update when not bored)
3. Install a version of py-spidev that works with kernels > 3.15

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/spidev (this is where you download the working version of py-spidev -- I can't know if the other steps I did where nessecary for this to work -- will try in the new raspberry pi -- hooray!)

* WARNING!

Be warned! (Not 100% sure about this... but about 95%)
After updating the kernel to enable spi, there is a chance that your usb wi-fi dongle stops working... (at least mine did, DWA-131).
Apparently, there is a problem with the 3.18 kernel and the driver that the device is using, as this driver was included later on as a patch in the kernel, and also, the USB ID of the wifi was not included in the current driver (jeez..)
Here how to get the driver edited:
